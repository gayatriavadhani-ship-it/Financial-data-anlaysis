📊 Finance Data Analysis using Power BI

I recently built a Finance Dashboard in Power BI to analyze sales and profit trends across countries and products.

Here’s what I explored:
✅ Total Sales and Profit across multiple regions
✅ Top and least performing products
✅ Country-wise profitability insights
✅ Same Period Last Year (SPLY) comparison for Sales and Profit
✅ Year-over-Year performance trend by date

This dashboard helps understand how performance has improved over time — for example, Total Sales grew from 26M to 119M, and Profit increased from 3.9M to 16.9M compared to the same period last year.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
🔹 DAX measures (CALCULATE, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, KPIs)
🔹 Data modeling and visualization
🔹 Storytelling through interactive visuals

Excited to keep improving and explore more advanced Power BI features like dynamic filtering, custom visuals, and performance insights! 🚀
